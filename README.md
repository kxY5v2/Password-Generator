# Password-Generator
The program creates a password based on gathered parameter the prints and writes the password to a file for later viewing.
This is a pretty basic program but I learned how to generate non-pseudo random numbers using SystemRandom() and writing to a file using with open.

The program asks the user whether they want numbers, letters, and symbols in their passwords followed by a request for length of password. 
All passwords are recorded in the PasswordList.txt file which if not found by computer, the program creates for the user.
